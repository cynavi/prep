title: JRE vs JVM vs JDK
---

## JVM
JVM is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.

When a Java program is run, Java compiler compiles hat code to bytecode and then JVM translates bytecode
into machine code. 

## JRE
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software tools that provides set of libraries, JVM, and other
components that are required to run Java applications. JRE is the superset of JVM.

## JDK
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit used to develop Java applications.
It physically exists. JDK is bundled with JRE, compilers, debuggers, Java doc and so on.


>_JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other
whereas Java is platform independent._
